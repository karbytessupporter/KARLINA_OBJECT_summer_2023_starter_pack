I've been feeling extra sentimental and grateful today. I am grateful for my parents, my siblings, my pets, and all the friends I've ever had. I want to be on good terms with everyone and to regard each of them as a member of my giant family. I do not want to hurt anyone. I want everyone to have the best in life. Even if we don't always like each other or get along or have unresolved conflicts, I still intend to treat everyone like a person who deserves to be happy, free, and well.
